### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Saeed and I am a software engineer. I have been writing code since 2010 and after more than 12 years I still need to code.

I am a full-time employee and don't have much time to code but I use every single minute of my free time to code :)

Here you can find some of the work that I am still maintaining.
