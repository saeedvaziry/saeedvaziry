### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Saeed and I am a software engineer. I am writing codes since 2010 and after more than 12 years I still need to code.

I am a full time employee and don't have much time to code but I use every single minute of my free times to code :)

Here you can find some of works that I am still maintaining.
